## Introduction

### What is Power Platform?

Blazor is a .NET web framework to build client web apps with C#.

Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.
More information on the [official Blazor website](https://blazor.net).

### Get started

To get started with Blazor, follow the instructions in the [Blazor Get Started](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/get-started) documentation.

Doing the [Build a web app with Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-blazor-webassembly-visual-studio-code/) learning session on Microsoft Learn can also be a good idea. Another great resource to start is the beginner serie by Jeff Fritz on [Channel9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-Blazor) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUJCA3DCzKT79Oe3kdKEceX).
